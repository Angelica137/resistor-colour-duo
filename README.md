# Resistor colour duo

From Exercism Python track. You can find the exercise ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/resistor-color-duo)

Create a program so that takes color names as input and outputs a two digit number, even if the input is more than two colors.

The band colors are have the below number values. WHich conveniently map to a zero based indexing:

- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

From the example above: brown-green should return 15 brown-green-violet should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.
